# MSmetaProfiler

This repository hosts Metabolome Annotation Workflow from LCMS-2 spectra in mzML format. The workflow has been developed using LCMS-2 dataset from a marine diatom _Skeletonema costatum_.

## Usage
### Installation


### Input files and Directories

An input directory (input_dir) should have the following files for the Workflow to run.
1. All LCMS-2 spectra .mzML files
2. SIRIUS installation zip folder
3. MetFrag jar file which can be downloaded from <https://github.com/ipb-halle/MetFragRelaunched/releases>. You can also download the MetFrag version shared in this repository.
4. MetFrag_AdductTypes.csv can be downloaded from <https://github.com/schymane/ReSOLUTION/blob/master/inst/extdata/MetFrag_AdductTypes.csv>
5. (optional) /QC folder containing all (MS1) QC .mzML files 
6. (optional) Suspect List in csv format (important column - "SMILES")
7. (optional) Sl_metfrag.txt (This file contains the InChIKeys for all SMILES in suspect list is generated by the python function - slist_metfrag) for MetFrag
8. (optional) ScostSLS/ (This folder is a fragmentation folder for each SMILES present in the suspect list and is generated by the python function - slist_SIRIUS) for SIRIUS 

### Tutorial of Workflow

1. Load Dependencies:

```library(Spectra)
library(MsBackendMgf)
library(MsBackendHmdb)
library(MsCoreUtils)
library(MsBackendMsp)
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(rvest)
library(stringr)
library(xml2)
```

2. Define input directory. Make sure that you have input LCMS-2 spectra files in .mzML format in the input directory.

```
input_dir <- "usr/s_cost/"
```
3. Load the open spectral libraries. This function will take a lot of computational resources. However, to skip this function, you can download the current versions of the these databases from <write the link here and ask where can you provide datasets>. The databases are stored in the same input directory and in .rda format, as a R object.

```
# db argument can take "all", "gnps", "mbank" and "hmdb". Default (and recommended) is "all".
download_specDB(input_dir, db = "all")
```
4. Load the database .rda objects to the current R session.
  
```
load(file = paste(input_dir,"gnps.rda", sep = ""))
load(file = paste(input_dir,"hmdb.rda", sep = ""))
load(file = paste(input_dir,"mbank.rda", sep = ""))
```
5. Create a table that lists all the input .mzML files and the result directories with the same name as the input file. The function ```ms2_rfilename``` gives an id to the file as well.
  
```
input_table <- data.frame(ms2_rfilename(input_dir))
```

6. (optional) If you are using QC files, follow these steps as well. QC samples are used to normalize the signals across all samples. So, generally, QC files contain all the signals from MS1 files with higher m/z resolution. These files also contain the isotopic peaks and can be usd for formula identification in SIRIUS. 
    1. If you have files with positive and negative modes in one file, follow the first section of code. It takes all files in the QC folder with a certain pattern (choose a pattern from your file names, could be even .mzML as this is the format of all files in QC folder) and divides the pos and neg modes from each file and generate different mode .mzML files (01pos.mzmL and 01neg.mzML). These files are read by "CAMERA", which is loaded within the function. the outputs are several csv files with CAMERA results, which are merged into one csv file for each mode.
    2. If you have files with positive and negative modes in separate files, follow the second section of code. It takes one file in the QC folder with either pos or neg mode. These files are read by "CAMERA", which is loaded within the function.
               
```
# first section
cam_funcMode(path = paste(input_dir, "QC", sep =""), pattern = "common")
merge_qc(path = paste(input_dir, "QC", sep =""))
```

```
# second section
cam_func(path = "QC/", f = "01pos.mzML", mode = "pos")
cam_func(path = "QC/", f = "02neg.mzML", mode = "neg")
```

7. (optional, follow if followed 6.) add the QC files to your input files. This can be done simply by adding one more column to the input_table and adding the pos files against pos mode LCMS2 data and neg files against neg mode LCMS2 files. An example is given below:
               
```
for (i in 1:nrow(input_table)){
    if (grepl("pos", input_table[i, "mzml_files"], fixed=TRUE)){
        input_table[i, "qcCAM_csv"] <- "./QC/Combined_Camera_pos.csv"
    }
    if (grepl("neg", input_table[i, "mzml_files"], fixed=TRUE)){
        input_table[i, "qcCAM_csv"] <- "./QC/Combined_Camera_neg.csv"
    }
}
```
  
8. After the previous steps, we have all the inputs, their directories and optionally the QC csv files. Next is to initiate the workflow, (assuming we want to process only one LCMS2 .mzML file). 
```
spec_pr <- spec_Processing(as.character(input_table[i, "mzml_files"]))
```
