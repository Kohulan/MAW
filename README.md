# MSmetaProfiler

This repository hosts Metabolome Annotation Workflow from LCMS-2 spectra in mzML format. The workflow has been developed using LCMS-2 dataset from a marine diatom _Skeletonema costatum_.

## Usage
### Installation
library(Spectra) <br>
library(MsBackendMgf) <br>
library(MsBackendHmdb) <br>
library(MsCoreUtils) <br>
library(MsBackendMsp) <br>
library(readr) <br>
library(dplyr) <br>
library(rvest) <br>
library(stringr) <br>
library(xml2) <br>

### Workflow
#### Input files and Directories

An input directory (input_dir) should have the following files for the Workflow to run.
1. All LCMS-2 spectra .mzML files
2. SIRIUS installation zip folder
3. MetFrag jar file which can be downloaded from <https://github.com/ipb-halle/MetFragRelaunched/releases>. You can also download the MetFrag version shared in this repository.
4. MetFrag_AdductTypes.csv can be downloaded from <https://github.com/schymane/ReSOLUTION/blob/master/inst/extdata/MetFrag_AdductTypes.csv>
5. (optional) /QC folder containing all (MS1) QC .mzML files 
6. (optional) Suspect List in csv format (important column - "SMILES")
7. (optional) Sl_metfrag.txt (This file contains the InChIKeys for all SMILES in suspect list is generated by the python function - slist_metfrag) for MetFrag
8. (optional) ScostSLS/ (This folder is a fragmentation folder for each SMILES present in the suspect list and is generated by the python function - slist_SIRIUS) for SIRIUS
