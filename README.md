# Whole Metabolome Annotation and Suspect List of _Skeletonema costatum_

## Suspect List Curation
Initial Suspect List contained compounds from KEGG, PubChem, MetaCyc, and BRENDAenzyme, LOTUS, CMNPD and Literature. The metadata included names, molecular formula, Species names, SMILES, InChI, Monoisotopic mass, different database IDs, and Source/ Reference. For the curation, the structural information from each entry is validated using RdKit and additional metadat is added via '''pubchempy'''.
